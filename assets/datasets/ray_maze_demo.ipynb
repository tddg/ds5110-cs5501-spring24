    "## Step 1: Setting Up a Simple Maze Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The application we are developing consists of a 2D maze game in which a single player can move in four directions. The maze is set up as a 5x5 grid (i.e., the size of the state space), with one of the 25 cells being the ultimate \"**goal**\" that the player, called the \"**seeker**\", must reach. Instead of providing a pre-determined solution, we will use a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm so that the seeker can learn how to find the goal through repeated simulations of the maze. The seeker will be rewarded for reaching the goal and the algorithm will track which decisions were successful and which were not. To make the process more efficient, we will use the Ray API to parallelize both the simulations and the training of the RL algorithm."

    "To start off, we will begin by creating the 2D maze. This involves creating a 5x5 grid in Python, which starts at (0, 0) and ends at (4, 4). We need to also define how the player can move around the grid. To do this, we will use a class called Discrete to represent the four cardinal directions of movement: up, down, left, and right. This class will allow us to move in multiple directions, rather than just four. "

To make things easier, we will always place the player at the coordinates (0, 0) and the goal at (4, 4).

How can it consistently find the goal in the minimum required number of **eight** steps?

In reinforcement learning, the player repeatedly plays the game and learns from their experiences.

However, if you have understood the explanations until now, you will probably find the rest of this notebook easy to follow. Mathematically, this was the most difficult part of this example. If you have worked with RL before, you will have realized that this is an implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm. It is called this because the state-action table can be represented as a function `Q(state, action)` that returns values for these pairs.\n",

    "In the field of RL, a full play-through of the maze game is referred to as an episode. That is why the `train_policy` function has an argument called `num_episodes`, rather than `num_games`. Now that we have a trained policy, we want to see how well it performs. Previously, we ran random policies a couple of times to get an idea of their effectiveness in the maze problem. However, we now want to properly evaluate our trained policy over multiple games and see how it performs on average. Specifically, we will run our simulation for several episodes and measure the number of steps it takes to reach the goal in each episode. To do this, we will implement an `evaluate_policy` function that accomplishes this task."

Now, consider whether the evaluation function would still be effective if the seeker was placed in random starting positions. Try making the necessary adjustments to find out. Additionally, think about the assumptions that were made when designing the algorithm, such as the assumption that all state-action pairs can be listed. Would this algorithm still work effectively if there were millions of states and thousands of actions?"

Next, we will define a parallel version of train_policy that is similar in structure to the original, but only parallelizes the rollouts, not the policy updates. Finally, we will train and evaluate the policy as before, but using the parallel version of train_policy.\n",

    "You should be able to understand the code presented in this section thanks to the knowledge of Ray Core that is covered in Lecture 6. While it may take some time to become comfortable with writing this type of code yourself, the concepts should be familiar to you. In the following example, we will demonstrate how to use a local Ray cluster to distribute the workload of reinforcement learning (RL) by creating a policy on the driver and four `SimulationActor` instances to perform distributed rollouts. We will store the policy in the object store with ray.put and pass it as an argument to the remote rollout calls to gather experiences over a specified number of training episodes. The finished rollouts will be retrieved with ray.wait, taking into account that some may finish before others, and the policy will be updated with the collected experiences. Finally, the trained policy will be returned."

    "The output of the two lines is the same as when we previously ran the single version of the RL training for the maze. It's helpful to compare `train_policy_parallel` and `train_policy` line by line because they have the same overall structure. All we had to do to parallelize the training process was to use the `ray.remote` decorator on a class appropriately and then make the correct remote calls. It's helpful to have some experience to do this correctly, but it's worth noting how little time we spent considering distributed computing and how much time we were able to focus on the actual application code. We didn't need to completely change our programming approach and were able to handle the problem in a natural way. This is what we want and Ray excels at providing this kind of flexibility. \n",
