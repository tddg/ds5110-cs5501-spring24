# Project

Day 1 file [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zZNPG_g_U95AtWlLUNq8nr_5F7HP-RG/view)


## Milestone and Deadlines

0. ~~Friday, 03/01, 11:00 am: Project bidding~~


1. ~~Friday, 03/22, 11:00 am: Project checkpoint 1~~

	* Proposal phase: report any preliminary results that you have.

2. ~~Friday, 04/12, 11:00 am: Project checkpoint 2~~

	* For data systems projects, you are expected to show prototypes.
	* For data analysis projects, you are expected to show general statistics of your datasets and concrete examples or case studies.


3. Friday, 05/01, 11:59 pm: Project everything due

	* For data systems project, you are expected to deliver a prototype and show some evaluation results.
	* For data analysis projects, you are expected to show your numbers and findings.



## Reports and Artifacts (code, datasets, etc.)

### Checkpoint #1: Proposal

Recommended structure for the checkpoint proposal report is:

* Title.
* Motivation + concrete problem statement (need not be formal, only concrete).
* Approaches/system_design/experiment_design proposed / planned to solve the aforementioned
problems: Initial thoughts + what you have done in design/setups/experimental_tests.
* Timeline/Expected milestones for achieving your goals.
* Any preliminary results that you have collected so far if any.

Your checkpoint report should describe your progress on achieving the
goals you included in your proposal. Clearly explain any changes you
have made to the goal of your project based on your experience so
far. Also, provide a concrete plan of what you will need to
accomplish in the remaining weeks to complete your project. It's OK
to report any preliminary results that you have already collected if any.

Your checkpoint #1 report should use a shared Google Doc.

About 1-2 pages is fine.
The **end product** of the proposal is a crisp **problem statement**. Please
submit your report via a shared Google Doc in Canvas (so we can comment on
specific lines).



### Checkpoint #2: Primary results

Similar as Checkpoint #1. What's more, you must include primary
results (e.g., small-scale measurement results, examples that your
prototype can already handle, etc). Please format your checkpoint #2
report using
[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [this Latex
template](https://github.com/tddg/project_latex_template); submissions
formatted with other templates are invalid. 
An example PDF can be found
[here](https://github.com/tddg/project_latex_template/blob/main/paper.pdf).

[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a software system for
document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as
opposed to the formatted text found in
[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) (what you see is
what you get) word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Doc.

You don't need to install Latex locally.  More conveniently, you
should use hosted Latex service such as
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for collaborative latex editing
with your teammates. 

UVA is providing [Overleaf professional
features](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/virginia) for all students,
faculty, and staff. 

Overleaf is designed to make the process of writing, editing and
producing your research papers and project reports much quicker for
both you and your collaborators. Overleaf can also be linked to other
services to best fit into your workflow.

**Give it a try if you have not used Latex/Overleaf
before!**

Your checkpoint #2 report should be built atop your checkpoint #1
report, and should be about 3-4 pages. 
The **end product** of this milestone is a description about:
1. your primary results and any insights/observations,
2. TODOs that you haven't completed but plan to get done by the end of the semester. 



### Final report

Your final report should be written like **a conference-quality paper**
that you read in class.
Following are some example questions that may help you organize your storyline:

* Question 0: What is/are your **main hypothesis/hypotheses** in the project? This is a one-sentence summary of your paper. Position your paper w.r.t. other related work on the same or even similar problems (reuse relevant parts of your survey report here!). Show to the reader that your work is on a unique point in the design spectrum. Don't overstate it, don't understate it either. This statement is related to Question 5 below (yes, it's a chicken and egg problem!)
* Question 1: What are your **goals**?
* Question 2: What is your **design and implementation** (for system/tool building)?
* Question 3: What are your research questions (for data analysis)?
* Question 4: What do your approaches **gain and lose** you? That is, what are the tradeoffs, if any?
* Question 5: What do your **results** tell you? (This is related to Question 0, 3, 4 above, and again, it's an egg and chicken problem!) Show that your data supports your hypothesis, and show the gains, losses, and tradeoffs by using your techniques/analysis/measurements.

As well as pay attention to:

* Importance of problem,
* Novelty of solution,
* Evaluation of solution,
* Clarity of Presentation,
* Nits (grammar, references, etc.).

Your paper must be **no longer than 5 pages and no shorter than 3 pages**. The paper
can have as many additional pages for references and for supplemental material
in appendices.
Please format your paper using the [this
template](https://github.com/tddg/project_latex_template);
submissions formatted with other templates are invalid.



### Project presentation format


The final project presentations will consist of **both** an
**in-class lightning presentation** and **a longer video-recorded
presentation** as part of the final submissions. As there are around
28 teams, the presentations will be split into two days: (1)
Wednesday, 04/24, and (2) Monday, 04/29. The first day slot will
accommodate around 14 teams, with the remaining 14 teams presenting
on the second day.

To follow a commonly used format in online conferences, each team
will have 5 minutes for the in-class lightning talk, with 3-4 minutes
dedicated to the actual presentation and 1-to-2 minutes for Q&A. We
will give a reminder at the 4-minute mark during your in-class
presentation. *Please be mindful about the timing when preparing your
slides! We don't want to run over time as some students have another
class scheduled at 5pm.*

**Additionally**, each team will prepare a 10-to-15-minute video
recording for a formal presentation, which will be included as part
of the final project deliverable (see next section) due by May 1st.
*So, do not worry if you could not include all the exciting stuff in
the limited, 5-minute in-class presentation slot. You will add those
in your recording.*



### Final project submission

Please prepare a 10-to-15-minute presentation and record your
presentation.

Submit everything by 11:59pm on Wednesday, 05/01, including:

* your final project report (in pdf) using 
[this template](https://github.com/tddg/project_latex_template),
* code/data (add the code repository link **in your final report** â€“ make sure your code repository is private and shared only with the teaching staff: if you choose to use GitHub, share it with this ID: tddg (which is [the instructor's github account](https://github.com/tddg)),
* and video (add the video link in your final report). 
Check [metadata.tex](https://github.com/tddg/project_latex_template/blob/main/metadata.tex) 
for detail about adding links.

Send the pdf of your final report on Canvas.

With your consent, we will post your recorded presentations
(preferably a YouTube URL) on the course webpage as a final showcase
of your achievement at the end of this semester! ðŸ˜Š
