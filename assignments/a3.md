# A Deeper Dive with Ray


## FAQs

* **PLEASE DO NOT PROCRASTINATE!!** 
* For A3, if your decide to create new VMs, you need to follow the same 
practice as you did for A1 and explicitly add a new security group by
allowing all TCP traffic. This is to ensure that your Ray workers are
able to communicate across the network using TCP.


## Changelogs

* MapReduce Task 2 updated: Each word should be in lowercase. 
* MapReduce data partitioning template code updated: fixed a bug
about the boundary bucket. **IMPORTANT:** You should use the updated template `ipynb` 
file for coding. The older version will yield a slightly different test outcome
that may fail the test. 
* MapReduce Part 2 dataset updated: The Project Gutenberg dataset is updated quietly
in the background, which might lead to inconsistent test outcomes if
you download it at different times. If you have previously downloaded
`a3_part2.zip`, please download it again and discard the previous
downloaded data. 


## Overview

This assignment is designed to support your in-class understanding of
how Ray tasks and actors work and get some hands-on experience in
programming them. You will need to deploy a five-node Ray cluster as
the distributed execution engine. You will then develop two
applications using Ray, a WordCount MapReduce program, and an
actor-based reinforcement learning (RL) training framework that
trains a DQN (Deep Q-Network) model capable of playing Lunar Lander.
You will also produce a short report detailing your observations,
takeaways, and experience.

This will be a fun assignment! ðŸ˜Ž


## Learning outcomes

The learning outcomes of this assignment are to:

* Configure and deploy Ray using SSH and Linux shell.
* Describe how Ray tasks and actors work.
* Write simple distributed Ray applications using Ray tasks and 
actors and run them in a cluster.



## Part 0: Environment setup

Like the previous assignments you will complete this assignment on
AWS. Hopefully by now you have got yourself familiar with setting
things up in AWS via Academy.
See [Assignment 0](/ds5110-cs5501-spring24/assignments/a0) about how 
to use AWS Academy to access AWS cloud resources. 
See [Assignment 1](/da5110-cs5501-spring24/assignments/a1) about how
to change network settings to enable ALL TCP traffic.
  
In this assignment, you should create a total of **five** EC2 VM
instances of type `t3.large` or `m5.large`. 
(Create five EC2 instances of the same
type in a batch and then rename them: hover over the instance name and click on
the edit button to change name; with a meaningful name like `vm1` to
`vm5` you can easily know which instance you are logging into 
for your Ray cluster) You will then deploy a five-node Ray cluster. 
To batch create multiple EC2 instances, follow the instructions from
[Assignment 0 (Step 1)](/ds5110-cs5501-spring24/assignments/a0#step-1-create-a-name-and-choose-an-os-image-for-your-vm).

However, it is fine to reuse your existing EC2 instances. If this is
the case, you need to add new instances to construct a five-node
cluster.


### Important step: Change network settings by adding a new ALL TCP security group

> **IMPORTANT:** You need to configure the **Network settings** of
> all
EC2 instances. Like previous assignments, for A3, you need to
**explicitly add a new security group by allowing all TCP traffic**.
*This is to ensure that your Dask workers are able to communicate
with your Dask scheduler using TCP.*

![Add Security Group in Network Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a1/add_security_group_TCP.png)

If this is a new EC2 instance, always run `apt update` before installing 
any dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
```

In A3, you do not need to setup the SSH password-free step.


## Part 1: Software deployment


### Ray parallel computing framework

[Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/index.html) 
is an open-source unified framework for scaling AI and Python
applications like machine learning. It provides the compute layer for
parallel processing so that you donâ€™t need to be a distributed
systems expert. In this assignment, you will learn how to program Ray
to implement distributed data processing and ML applications. 



### Step 1: Install the software

First, install the `ray[default]` (Ray Core) module for general
Python applications on each of the five EC2 VM instances.  

```sh
$ pip3 install "ray[default]"
$ source ~/.profile
```

Verify if Ray is installed sucessfully on your VM instances via the
following command.

```sh
$ ray --version
```

This command should output the following information: `ray, version 2.9.3`.  



### Step 2: Start your Ray cluster

Your Ray cluster consists of a head node and multiple worker nodes.
Each {head or worker} node has three layers: a computing layer, a
storage layer, and a scheduler layer.

Now that you have installed the Ray software in Step 1. In this step,
you will start a Ray cluster. 

On your head node `vm1`:

```sh
$ ray start --head --port=6379
```

The `start` command provides detailed instructions for the next steps
of Ray cluster setup. Simply follow that to launch your Ray workers
on the other four EC2 instances.

OR, you can follow my instructions to start the Ray worker processes
on your worker nodes {`vm2`, `vm3`,	`vm4`, `vm5`} via the following
command:

```sh
$ ray start --address='<private_IPv4_addr_vm1>:6379'
```

Check the current status of your Ray cluster using:

```sh
$ ray status
```

Great! You have a five-node Ray cluster up and running.  The figure
below depicts a birds-eye view of your Ray cluster's architecture.
You still need SSH port forwarding (`-L 8000:localhost:8888`) in
order to access the remote Jupyter Notebook server that you run on
`vm1`.

![Ray Cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a3/ray_cluster.png)


Like Dask and Spark, Ray also provides a handy dashboard UI.  To
access the Ray dashboard, you need to specify port forwarding when
you SSH into `vm1`. To do so:

```sh
$ ssh -i "vockey.pem" ubuntu@<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_vm1> -L 8265:localhost:8265
```
Enter `localhost:8265` or `127.0.0.1:8265` on your browser to access
the Ray dashboard. Attached below is a snapshot of how the Ray dashboard
looks like.

![Ray Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a3/ray_dashboard1.png)



## Part 2: MapReduce on Ray

In this part, you will exercise Ray remote task programming. Specifically,
you will implement a simple MapReduce application (WordCount) 
on your Ray cluster. We have provided three files and a directory.
Download the zipf file
at [this link](https://tddg.github.io/ds5110-cs5501-spring24/assets/datasets/a3_part2.zip)
using `wget`.
The zip file includes: 

* ~~a `download_gutenberg.sh` bash script to download the text files as the input;~~ 

> **NOTE:** Project Gutenberg is updating the text of its eBooks, causing inconsistent test results; therefore, we will use a snapshot of the text datasets from 98 eBooks downloaded in Feburary 2024 for testing.

* a `mr_txt` directory containing all the Project Gutenberg text files;

* a `ray_mr_skeleton.ipynb` MapReduce skeleton file to help you get started;

* a `test_mr.sh` bash script for testing and autograding;

* and a `mr_correct_wc.txt` file that will be used by `test_mr.sh` for autograding.

The only file that you need to modify is `ray_mr_skeleton.ipynb`.
**Please do not modify `download_gutenberg.sh`, `test_mr.sh`, and
`mr_correct_wc.txt`.**

~~To start off, run `download_gutenberg.sh` to  dowload a total of 98
text files into a new directory called `./mr_txt` (this script will
automatically create this directory for you):~~

All the text files are contained in the `mr_txt` directory. These
text files will be the input of your WordCount application.

> **IMPORTANT:** If you previously downloaded the Project Gutenberg
files, you should just remove the downloaded files and instead use
the text files supplied in the `mr_txt` directory decompressed from
`a3_part2.zip`.

Implement the WordCount MapReduce job in the provided skeleton
Notebook file (you should change the Notebook file name for
submission).


To initialize a Ray client, run the following Python code:

```py
ray.init(address="ray://<private_IPv4_addr_vm1>:10001")
```

Once your Notebook session successfully connects to Ray cluster's
head node, you should execute the following cell to check if your 
Ray cluster has the required number of worker nodes:

```py
print('''This cluster consists of
    {} nodes with
    {} CPUs,
    {} GiB of aggregate memory capacity, and 
    an object store of {} GiB of memory.
    '''.format(len(ray.nodes()), ray.cluster_resources()['CPU'], 
           ray.cluster_resources()['memory'] / (1024*1024*1024), 
           ray.cluster_resources()['object_store_memory'] / (1024*1024*1024)))
```

### Your job

Your job is to implement a distributed MapReduce WordCount
application, consisting of two programs, a mapper and a reducer.
There is a client driver, and multiple Ray worker processes on
multiple EC2 instances, executing map and reduce tasks in parallel.

The client will first prepare the input datasets by reading all word
text into a `corpus` list and partition it into *M* buckets (i.e.,
partitions, equivalent to the concept of HDFS file blocks),
where *M* is the number of map tasks. The client will then dispatch the
input buckets to the map tasks running on your Ray workers. 
Note that the number of map tasks could be larger than that of available
Ray workers deployed in your cluster. *M* `do_map_task` will be invoked 
in parallel to execute the map tasks. 

A high-level visualization of WordCount is shown in the figure below.
In this example, three map tasks are launched on two Ray processes,
two on the head node and one on worker 1. Two reduce tasks are
launched on worker 2. Each map and reduce task is assigned one CPU
core. Note in your MapReduce implementation, however, since the
reduce phase will not start untill all map tasks are complete, the
reduce tasks will likely get assigned to the same set of CPU cores
that ran the map tasks seconds ago. The intermediate results span 
a list of `3 x 2 = 6` buckets, this is because this WordCount has
3 map tasks and 2 reduce tasks. The final outputs span 2 buckets, each
produced by a reduce task. These partial outputs will eventually be
merged together by the provided client code.

![Ray MapReduce]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a3/ray_mr.png)


You will complete four tasks for this part:

**Task 1:** Your first task of this assignment is to implement the
logic of WordCount's map task, `do_map_task`. `do_map_task` is defined
as a `@ray.remote()` task, and therefore, the client driver needs to
send it the input data as function arguments. 
`do_map_task` will perform the following two tasks:

1.  Call `map_function()` (see Task 2) on the input bucket to emit a
list of key-value (KV) pairs, where each KV pair is a `(word, 1)`
tuple.
2.  Calculate which reduce task a `(word, 1)` KV pair
should go to and append the KV pair to the corresponding intermediate
results bucket. Each map task will generate *N* intermediate results
buckets.  Each intermediate results bucket will be later processed by
an associated reduce task.

**Task 2:** Your second task is to implement `map_function`, which
simply converts a `map_input` into a list of KV pairs, where the key
is the word and the value is set to 1. 

> **IMPORTANT:** The 'word' in each KV pair emitted should be in
> **lowercase** so that the same words, regardless of their original
> case, can be reduced (combined) in the reduce phase.

**Task 3:** Your third task is to implement the reduce method,
`do_reduce_task`. `do_reduce_task` is also defined as a
`@ray.remote()` task. Therefore, each reduce task will take as input
*M* intermediate result buckets, each produced by a map task and
consumed by this reduce task. `do_reduce_task` will perform the following
tasks: 

1.  Iterate over each input bucket and populate a dict-based table
with the key as each unique word and the value as a list of all `1`s
associated with that key.
2.  Iterate each item in the table and sum all `1`s under each key
by calling `reduce_function()` (Task 4).
Return an output table with the word as the key and its count as
the value.

**Task 4:** Your fourth task is to implement `reduce_function`, which
simply returns the number of items (`1`s) in the input argument
`val`.

To test your code, run the driver code to launch the entire MapReduce
WordCount pipeline on your Ray cluster. How the driver code works:

The driver code is divided into two parts: a first part that invokes
all map tasks in parallel, and a second part that invokes all reduce
tasks in parallel. Each map task will take an `map_input` and 
generate a list of return values, where each return value is an
intermediate results bucket (`intermediate_results`) that will be
consumed by a reduce task (`num_returns = num_reduce_tasks`). 

The reduce phase will start right after the map phase concludes. 
Each reduce task will take as input a list of *M* `map_output` from
`intermediate_results`. Once all *N* reduce tasks are done, a list of
*N* `merged_partial_results` buckets is produced. 

Run the next cell to collect and aggregate all reduce tasks' outputs
at the client. This cell will print the top 20 words with the highest
counts. To test the correctness of your implementation, run the `test_mr.sh`
test script from the wc test cell:
```sh
!bash ./test_mr.sh
```


## Part 3: RL training on Ray 


### Software installation

For this part, you will need several new software dependencies in
order to support the RL training and game environments.

```sh
$ sudo apt install -y swig
$ pip3 install gym==0.21.0 cffi mujoco-py==0.5.7 'gym[box2d]' torch numpy
```

To enable game play visualization, you need the following dependencies
(see [Visualizing game playing](/ds5110-cs5501-spring24/assignments/a3#visualizing-game-playing)):

```sh
$ sudo apt install -y xvfb freeglut3-dev python3-opengl 
$ pip3 install pyopengl pyglet==1.5.11 pyvirtualdisplay matplotlib
```

### DQN and game environment

In this part, you will exercise Ray actor programming.
Specifically, you will implement a distributed actor framework that
parallelizes the training of a reinforcemnet learning (RL) model on a
Ray cluster. The RL model that you train in this part will excel in
playing the game of 
[Lunar Lander](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/).
The algorithm to train the RL model is DQN (Deep Q-Network). Here are
some resources to help you become acquainted with DQN: 

* [The Deep Q-Network (DQN)](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit3/deep-q-network)
* [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf)
* [Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)


### Your job

We have procided two Notebook files to help you get started.
Download the file from [this link](https://tddg.github.io/ds5110-cs5501-spring24/assets/datasets/a3_part3.zip) using `wget`. 
The zip file includes two Notebook files:

* a `single_node_dqn.ipynb` file, which contains a standalone implementation
of a single-node DQN training program; it provides hints on how one could implement
a distributed version of DQN training (see **Hint 2** below);

* a `ray_cluster_dqn_skeleton.ipynb` file, which marks TODO tasks for
you to complete.

Your job is to implement a distributed actor framework, which
collectively trains a DQN model to excel in the Lunar Lander game.
This distributed actor framework consists of *N* `Agent` actors
distributed across the cluster, each responsible for training a local
model in a different game environment and synchronizing
with a global parameter server -- a `GlobalNet` actor (i.e., the
global parameter server) -- running on `vm1`.
`GlobalNet` does two things:
(1) updating the global model by aggregating model parameters trained at
each Agent actor,
and (2) periodically testing the global model trained to determine if
the model is well trained.
See the figure below for an illustration about the architecture of
the RL actor framework. Since you have five EC2 instances, by default
you need one EC2 instance to host the `GlobalNet` actor and four
instances to host the four `Agent` actors.
This framework setup is configurable; see Task 6 below.

![Ray RL]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a3/ray_rl.png)

In this part, you are not asked to write specific logic for the two
kinds of actors. The actors are already implemented. You are expected
to implement **control logic** around the training `for` loop of the
driver code. The control logic is supposed to control and coordinate
each actor to perform its own job in a training episode.
Specifically, this part features seven tasks as follows:

* **Task 0:** In this task, you will add the Ray actor decorator
to the right places to indicate which code will be actors.

* **Task 1:** In this task, you will write control logic to:
	1. Initialize a `GlobalNet` actor and a cluster of *N* `Agent` actors, where *N* is determined by `num_agents` that you configured.
	2. Distribute the initialized model weights to all *N* `Agent` actors.

* **Task 2:** In this task, you will write control logic that trains
the `Agent` actors in parallel.  

* **Task 3:** In this task, you will write control logic that tells
the `GlobalNet` actor to collect local weights from each `Agent` actor
and perform an average operation on the collected weights.

* **Task 4:** In this task, you will write control logic that tells
each `Agent` actor to perform a model weight synchronization
operation by fetching the globally averaged model weights from the
`GlobalNet` actor.

* **Task 5:** In this task, you will write control logic to: 
	1. have the `GlobalNet` actor play a series of test game and print the average reward score fetched from `GlobalNet`,
the same way it does in single-node training. 
	2. set the termination condition; the training will terminate if either one of the following two conditions is met:
		* If the average game reward is equal to or greater than **100**,
		* OR, if the number of training episodes has reached 1000
(unlikely to hit this condition though). 
	3. save the trained model once the average score reaches 100, by calling `torch.save(global_weights, './model_checkpoint.pth')`.

> **Hint 1:** The deliverable of this part should target a `average_game_reward` of 100
However, for debugging purpose, you may use a smaller
target score, say 20 or 30 so that you donâ€™t need to wait for too
long during that process. To give you some idea about how long a
distributed training may take: the training time on a five-node
cluster cound range from 500 seconds to
1000 seconds when the target score is set to 100; it might take
around 200-300 seconds to train if the target score is set to 30.
The training time varies (sometimes significantly) across runs. 
*Can you explain why the variance is so high for RL training?*


* **Task 6:** Tune three key hyper-parameters (`num_agents`, `batch_size`,
and `num_epochs_agents_train`) to understand
how they would affect the key training metrics such as training time
and training quality. For example, you could tune the number of
`Agent` actors `num_agents` and the amount of CPU resources assigned
to the `Agent` actors and the `GlobalNet` actor. By default the CPU
resource is set to `num_cpu=2`. 
That's the maximum CPUs that you could allocate to an actor, as
each EC2 instance is equipped with 2 CPUs only. However, you could
reduce it to, say, `num_cpu=1` so that you can have more actors 
train a model in parallel. With `num_cpu=1` for `Agent` and `GlobalNet`
actors, you could run at most 9 `Agent` actors and 1 `GlobalNet` actor
in your five-node cluster. Try it and see how it would affect your 
end-to-end training time: here, training time reflects the training quality:
the longer it takes to reach a reward score of 100, the worse the training
quality. 
Similarly, tune `batch_size` and `num_epochs_agents_train`  and see 
their impact. 
`batch_size` denotes the number of states an `Agent` actor
retrieves from `ReplayBuffer` for local training. 
`num_epochs_actors_train` denotes the maximum number of episodes that
an `Agent` trains locally before sending the local model to
`GlobalNet` and updating its local model with the global model.
Report your observations and reasoning in your report. 
You may want to draw a timeline of the average game reward scores for
comparing differnet combinations of hyperparameters.  


> **Hint 2:** The implementation of `GlobalNet` and `Agent` is well
commented. The comments there provide some hints about how you should
call the already implemented methods from these two classes in order
to complete Task 1-5. You need to read the code carefully. 
Distributed training using `Agent` actors and `GlobalNet` actor mirrors
the process of single node training. 
Several differences between `single_node_dqn.ipynb` and
`ray_cluster_dqn.ipynb`: 
(1) Distributed training offloads and
parallelizes the training to a cluster and relies on a centralized
parameter server for global model synchronization. 
(2) Each `Agent` in a distributed training setting trains
`num_epochs_actor_train` episodes before synchronizing with
`GlobalNet`, while the `Learner` directly trains a local model
in the single-node version. You should also read the code in
`single_node_dqn.ipynb`, which hints on how one could potentially
organize control logic code to implement actor-based distributed
training. 


> **Hint 3:** RL training is a long-running process. You should always
use the dashboard to monitor the execution progress of your training
job. On the dashboard UI, click on the `Cluster` tab to view the
real-time CPU and memory resource usage (see an example snapshot
below).  You can also view the executions of actors by clicking on
the `Jobs` tab or the `Actors` tab.

![Ray Dashboard Resource Usage]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a3/ray_dashboard_dist_training.png)


### Visualizing game playing

The last piece of Notebook cells in the Ray cluster DQN training
Notebook is for visualizing the game play.
The code will load the saved model checkpoint that you trained and
generate video clips to visualize the game playing process. See
a snapshot below.

![Lunar Lander Snapshot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a3/lunar_lander_snapshot.png)



## Deliverables

You should submit a `tar.gz` file to Canvas, which follows the naming
convention of `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A3.tar.gz`. The
submitted file should include:

* an `.ipynb` file containing the code of all tasks for Part 2: Ray
MapReduce (filename: `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A3_Part2.ipynb`), 
* an `.ipynb` file containing the code of all tasks for Part 3: Ray
RL (filename: `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A3_Part3.ipynb`),
* and a short `PDF` report (filename: `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A3_report.pdf`).

The skeleton we supplied is well documented with clearly marked
`TODO`s to tell you where you should add your own code.  Your code
should be well commented as well. The code comment should include
Part number and Task number and include a brief description of the
implementation. Comments are worth some percentage of your grade for
the assignment, the GTAs will be looking at your code as well as the
comments (comments serve as a `README` for a particular task).  

For the **PDF report**, in addition to the observations and reasoning
for Task 6, you should also report anything that you learned from
this assignment, from measurement statistics and insights that you
learned, new skills and new hands-on experience you picked up, or
something that you would have liked to try but did not get a chance
to, just to list a few.
